    desc: `Bacon wrapped food is a style of food preparation, where bacon is wrapped around other ingredients or dishes, and either grilled, fried, or baked.
          Many of the wrapped foods, such as livers and asparagus, cook more quickly than bacon itself does, and when preparing such dishes it is thus necessary to part-cook the bacon separately, before wrapping the filling and cooking the complete dish. Bacon-wrapped foods can include many things including filet mignon, chicken nuggets, pork chops, shrimp, Juicy Lucy, and tenderloin`,

        You can wrap your food in raw bacon and then cook both together. If the main food is done first you can turn the food on its side so that the bacon is now touching the grate so that you can crisp it up. But make sure and this is important, to turn down that heat to about 375-400.`,
